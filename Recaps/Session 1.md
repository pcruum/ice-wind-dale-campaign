The session starts in a tavern in [[Brin Shander]], in which [[Arlian]], [[Fyndrael]], [[Kahina El-Enna]], [[Tapat]] and [[Vita'e Mors]] sit around a table. Each came to listen to the proposal of [[Danika]] for a mission. The goal would be to catch a [[Twinga]] with whom she can do experiments. The reward would be 15 gold pieces after a bit of negotiation. [[Danika]] also tells the group, that strange occurrences happend in [[Easthaven]]. which could be related to [[Twinga]].

As soon as [[Arlian]] wants to go outside to buy some equipment for the journey, [[Garn the Hammer]] rushes into the tavern dragging three dwarfs behind him. He exclaims loudly that the dwarfs lost his precious iron supply on the way from [[Kelvin's Cairn]] due to an "imaginary" [[Yeti]]. [[Vita'e Mors]], [[Tapat]] and [[Fyndrael]] ignore him and go on to search for equipment.

The trio is guided by [[Fyndrael]] who leads them to a shop with fishing equipment since he misunderstood the wants from [[Vita'e Mors]]. They split up; [[Tapat]] returns to the tavern while [[Fyndrael]] and [[Vita'e Mors]] find another shop with the correct equipment. They buy three snowshoe pairs, paying way to much.

Meanwhile in the tavern, [[Garn the Hammer]] asks if someone is willing to retrieve is iron supplies which should not be too far away from the city. [[Arlian]] and [[Kahina El-Enna]] agree to postpone the journey to [[Easthaven]] in order to retrieve the wagon. Thanking them, [[Garn the Hammer]] takes them to his shop to gift them supplies. On the way, they meet up again with [[Tapat]]. They receive snowshoes and a shovel for free.

The whole group meets up again on the way north and [[Vita'e Mors]] throws away the pair of snowshoes he bought for [[Tapat]].

On the way north, they get into a snowstorm. However, [[Tapat]] quickly builds an Iglu with the shovel, in which they find shelter.

After the storm settles, the group continues north. But they feel like they are moving way too long. In the distance, the group sees smoke rising in the east and head towards the source. In a small forest, they meet a [[Dire Wolf]] which talks to them. The group cannot persuade the [[Dire Wolf]] to give up the supply wagon and get attacked. 

The first wolf in the bushes gets taken care of in the beginning. [[Tapat]] and [[Kahina El-Enna]] run towards the [[Dire Wolf]], while the rest try to hide behind. Suddenly, [[Fyndrael]] gets jumped on by another wolf. [[Vita'e Mors]], who stands next to him, knocks the wolf out, refusing to kill him. Out of the surprise, [[Fyndrael]] finishes the senseless wolf. Meanwhile, [[Tapat]] and [[Kahina El-Enna]] keep the [[Dire Wolf]] in check and it almost dies in the fighting. Scared, it runs away. 

The group does not follow because [[Vita'e Mors]] teleports to [[Fyndrael]], grabbing him. [[Fyndrael]] in turn teleports away from him. [[Tapat]] tries to intervene, but quickly gives up. In this moment, [[Vita'e Mors]] attacks [[Fyndrael]] with a spell. A short fight erupts between the two in which [[Vita'e Mors]] knocks out [[Fyndrael]]. 

After [[Fyndrael]] wakes up, he leaves the group momentarily since he feels not save around someone who attacked him seemingly without reason. However, later on, he returns to the group and the two discuss the matter.
