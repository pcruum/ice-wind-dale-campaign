The largest building in [[Good Mead]] contains the apiaries and is said to be under renovation at the moment.

There is a constant buzzing noise around it, but the building itself seems to have been avoided for a little while.

Inside, the hall is seems cold and abandoned. There are some fleshy structures and a few humanoid skeletons. The cellar is much warmer and there are other fleshy structures present and active [[Weird bees]] flying about.
