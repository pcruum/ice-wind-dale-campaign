A temple to [[Amaunator]] in [[Bryn Shander]]. It is the largest temple in [[Icewind Dale]], though still small in comparison to its equivalents on the outside.
It is currently maintained by [[Mishann]].

[[Mishann]] and [[Copper Knobberknocker]] tried to remove the curse of the [[Cursed Statue]].

Now, the temple seems to be destroyed and abandoned. The usual feeling of warm sunlight is gone. The [[Cursed Statue]] is still present and defended by a [[Ghost]].
