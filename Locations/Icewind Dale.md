A small stretch of land in the far north of Faer√ªn, cought between the [[Spine of the World]] and the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]. Few people live there and fewer still attempt the hard journey.
For the last two years, the Dale has been plunged into an eternal night and through that everlasting winter. Each night at midnight, the northern lights illuminate the sky until the moment the sun is usually supposed, but now fails, to rise.
Most of its inhabitants believe [[Auril]] to be responsible for the Everlasting Rime.
