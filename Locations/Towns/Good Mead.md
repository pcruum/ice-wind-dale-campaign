A small town known for the logging activities and more importantly the name giving mead they sell throughout [[Ten Towns]].

The mead deliveries have stopped since about one and a half weeks.

Something odd is going on. The locals are very cagey about [[Kendrick Rielsbarrow]]'s death and the cessation of mead deleveries.
